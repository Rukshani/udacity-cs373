# question 1
print "is sigma-square of gaussian from combining 2 other gaussians"
print "of same variance smaller, larger, same as old variance?"
print "smaller variance, higher information content"

# question 2
print "say we have a prior gaussian, mu, sigma-square"
print "and a measurement gaussian with same parameters."
print "what will covariance of new gaussian be after multiplying these?"
print "new sigma-square will be half of old sigma-square"
