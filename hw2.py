# question 1
print "measurement update"
print "is sigma-square of gaussian from combining 2 other gaussians"
print "of same variance smaller, larger, same as old variance?"
print "smaller variance, higher information content"

# question 2
print "new variance"
print "say we have a prior gaussian, mu, sigma-square"
print "and a measurement gaussian with same parameters."
print "what will covariance of new gaussian be after multiplying these?"
print "new sigma-square will be half of old sigma-square"

# question 3
print "heavytail gaussian"
print "is it possible to have a heavytail gaussian using"
print " the standard gaussian formula and changing mu and sigma?"
print "no"

# question 4
print "how many dimensions?"
print "object tracked in 2D using kalman filters estimating"
print "position and velocity"
print "how many dimensions in the state vector?"
